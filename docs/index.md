**LinkUp is a desktop application for managing your contact details.**
Tailored for organisation team leaders, LinkUp does more than just keep contact information
— it helps you capture each member’s unique skills and roles in events, all in one place.

Although LinkUp features a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most interactions are performed through a Command Line 
Interface (CLI), where users type commands directly into the command line.

* If you are interested in using LinkUp, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing LinkUp, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
