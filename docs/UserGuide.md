## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source:  Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in uppercase are information you need to provide.<br>
  e.g. For `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with an actual name. 
  * You can type in `add n/John Doe` or `add n/Michael Jordan` etc.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. In `n/NAME [s/SKILL]`, `s/SKILL` is optional. 
  * You can type `n/John Doe s/Java` or `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including not at all).<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…​` means you can add 0 skills, 1 skill, or many.
  * You can type ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/Java`, or `s/Photography s/Cooking` etc.

* Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. If you type in `help 123`, it will be treated as just `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as 
  space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Save the Data

LinkUp data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Edit the Data File

LinkUp data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, LinkUp will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the LinkUp to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous LinkUp home folder.

**Q**: How do I edit only 1 of my 2 skills for a specific contact? <br>
**A**: You would have to edit both skills in order for you to see the changes. So assuming
you have `skills: Boxing, Drumming` but you wish to change Drumming to Singing, you can only do this by using the `edit` command
and typing `edit [INDEX] s/Boxing s/Drumming` or `e [INDEX] s/Boxing s/Drumming`.

**Q**: Why am I unable to run the `LinkUp.jar` file? <br>
**A**: Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer. You can type `java -version` in your command terminal
of your computer to check.
* For Mac users, follow the setup guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
  ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed.
* For Windows users, follow the setup guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html)
  ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed.
* For Linux users, follow the setup guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)
  ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed.

Then, open the command terminal of your computer, and navigate into the folder you put the `LinkUp.jar` file in.
You can do this by using the `cd` function. For example, if `LinkUp.jar` is in the Downloads folder of your computer,
type `cd Downloads` in the command terminal to navigate into the Downloads folder.
Finally, type `java -jar LinkUp.jar` command to run the application. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
