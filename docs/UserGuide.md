## **Features**

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* **Words in uppercase are information you need to provide.**<br>
  e.g. For `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with an actual name.
  * You can type in `add n/John Doe` or `add n/Michael Jordan` etc.
  
  <br>

* **Items in square brackets are optional.**<br>
  e.g. In `n/NAME [s/SKILL]`, `s/SKILL` is optional.
  * You can type `n/John Doe s/Java` or `n/John Doe`.

  <br>

* **Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.**<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…​` means you can add 0 skills, 1 skill, or many.
  * You can type ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/Java`, or `s/Photography s/Cooking` etc.

  <br>
  
* **Fields can be in any order.**<br>
  e.g. If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* **Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters** (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) **will be ignored.**<br>
  e.g. If you type in `help 123`, it will be treated as just `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as
  space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Data Storage
#### Save the Data

LinkUp data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<br>

#### Edit the Data File

LinkUp data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
    <b>Caution:</b>
    If you edit the data file incorrectly and make its format invalid, LinkUp will not load any contacts at startup.
    Adding a new person in this state will cause LinkUp to <i>overwrite the existing file</i> with only the new contact.
    Therefore, it is recommended to <i>always back up your data file</i> before making manual changes.

## **Troubleshooting**
### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Launching LinkUp
**Why am I unable to run the `LinkUp.jar` file?** <br>
Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer. After installing LinkUp, type `java -jar LinkUp.jar` in your command terminal to launch LinkUp.
Refer to [_Quick Start_](#quick-start) for the detailed LinkUp launching process.

#### LinkUp Data
**How do I save my data in LinkUp?** <br>
LinkUp data is saved in your computer automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually. This means that your contact list will be restored whenever you reopen LinkUp. <br>

**How do I transfer my data to another computer?** <br>
Install LinkUp on the other computer, then replace the new data file in your other computer with the data file from your original computer's LinkUp. <br>

#### Contact detail management
**How do I edit only 1 of my 2 skills for a specific contact?** <br>
You would have to edit both skills in order for you to see the changes. So assuming
you have `skills: Boxing, Drumming` but you wish to change Drumming to Singing, you can only do this by using the `edit` command
and typing `edit [INDEX] s/Boxing s/Drumming` or `e [INDEX] s/Boxing s/Drumming`.

**Why am I unable to run the `LinkUp.jar` file?** <br>
Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer and the correct `LinkUp.jar` file. 
Follow the instructions at [_Quick Start_ ](#quick-start) to re-download the Java Developer Kit (JDK) and `LinkUp.jar` file.
To ensure that the JDK version is correct, type `java -version` in the command terminal of your computer to check.

**How do I add multiple Roles and Events to an existing contact?** <br>
You can use the `edit` command. So assuming your contact is a participant for an EWP event, and an invigilator for an exam event,
you can type `edit [INDEX] ev/EWP r/Participant ev/Exam r/Invigilator`. Ensure that the `ev/EVENT` and the corresponding `r/ROLE` are
beside each other.

**How do I edit only 1 of my 2 Event-Role pairs for a specific contact?** <br>
You would have to edit both Event-Role pairs in order for you to see the changes. So assuming
you have `Events: [AngBao Hunt, Exam]; Roles: [Organiser, Invigilator]` but you wish to change Ang Bao Hunt to EWP, you can only do this by using the `edit` command
and typing `edit [INDEX] ev/EWP r/Organiser ev/Exam r/Invigilator` or `e [INDEX] ev/EWP r/Organiser ev/Exam r/Invigilator`. <br>

**Can I edit Event information of a contact only?** <br>
No. You would have to edit the Role of the contact too. Each event should have a corresponding Role. So assuming you have
`Events: [AngBao Hunt]; Roles: [Organiser]` but you wish to change AngBao Hunt to Exam, you can only do this by using the `edit` command
and typing `edit [INDEX] ev/Exam r/Organiser` or `e [INDEX] ev/Exam r/Organiser`. <br>

**What if I type 2 events and 1 role when adding/editing a contact?** <br>
Assuming you typed `edit [INDEX] ev/EWP r/Participant ev/Exam`, the second event will not be saved. Only `Events: [EWP]; Roles: [Participant]`
will be saved. Each event should have a corresponding role.

**Can I add a new contact with the same phone number?** <br>
Adding a contact with an existing phone number / email address / name / telegram handle is not allowed.

### Known Issues

* **Issue:** When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. <br>
**Solution:** Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
* **Issue:** If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. <br>
**Solution:** Manually restore the minimized Help Window.
