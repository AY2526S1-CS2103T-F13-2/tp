This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## About This Project

Our group observed that our peers who hold leadership commitments struggle to manage contacts effectively.
Traditional address books quickly become *messy and overwhelming* when handling large numbers of people.
Leaders not only need to store contact details, but also keep track of roles and event-specific groups,
making coordination difficult.

To solve this, we created **LinkUp** â€” a lightweight, intuitive contact management tool designed for
community and club leaders.

With **LinkUp**, leaders can:
* Filter contacts based on events (e.g. orientation organising members)
* Organise people by role (e.g. family, event volunteers, event organisers)
* Onboard new team members effortlessly
* Avoid the complexity of heavy software while keeping everything streamlined
